                    <ul>
                    <li class="hiddenskill1">Communication comes from building trustworthiness and a willingness to listen. I highly value the contributions of all parts of my team, and put strong effort into building relationships from the beginning. I've spent over a decade practicing and teaching verbal and non-verbal communication. I strive to be sure what I am communicating is both clear and valuable. I work well with diverse audiences, paying particularly close attention to an individual's needs, preferences, and habits in communication.</li>

                  <li class="skillsbutton2">Data Analysis</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="hiddenskill2">As a teacher and coach, I provide a decade of experience in determining what data to collect, how to best collect it, and how drive action from the results.  I can pull meaning out of user stories and large spreadsheets alike. I believe that the best decisions are made with full information in hand. Knowing how a user actually interacts with a product keeps the focus on providing for the customer. I see data as a tool to increase the quality of our work, and it is one which I feel very comfortable wielding.</li>

                  <li class="skillsbutton3">Flexibility</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="hiddenskill3">Though I work hard to prepare for any contingencies up front, I am proud of my ability to adapt to any situation. I enjoy the challenge of making changes based on new data or moving targets. I always guide my decisions based on the big picture and overall value. The feeling of soliciting feedback from a team and moving things forward in everyone's interest is a big part of what draws me to work in an Agile environment.  I have made a career of taking in new information and quickly being able to turn that into a decision that betters the individual or whole group.</li>

                    <ul>
                    <li class="hiddenskill4">Throughout my work experience, I have been tasked with mastering exacting timelines and tight budgets. I consistently produce the highest quality outcomes while balancing time and resources over multiple, simultaneous projects. As a program manager, I would ensure all work actively contributes toward project goals and provides excellent value to the company and customer.</li>

               <h4>Tahoma Audubon </h4>
                <p>As a member of the Tahoma Audubon Society, I have contributed to conservation efforts, taken part in citizen science projects, collaborated with other birders on field trips, completed the Advanced Birding class, and frequently attended lectures.</p>

                <h4>Musical Director: Disney's Lion King 2015, BBBPress's We Are Monsters 2016, Disney's Mulan 2017</h4>
                <p>While serving as a musical director I created a quality experience for sold-out shows by developing, adapting, and maintaining a  production schedule with appropriate quality and risk management. Additionally, I empowered 10-12 year old students to run all sound and lighting for live shows in venues with differing capabilities.</p>
